<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Ocean's 11</h3>
<p>One of the best heist movies of all time, whole trilogy is a masterpiece. The cast, with Brad Pitt in his very hot era, George Clooney who is hilarious and Julia Roberts oh the woman you are. The dynamic between Danny and Rusty is unmatched, some of the best bros that have ever appeared in tv. And the heist in itself with the whole oh no we lost vibe until you realise it was all part of the plan!!! We love to see it.</p>
<h3>Little Women</h3>
<p>I'm talking about the 2019 version with the queen herself Saoirse Ronan as Jo, Florence Pugh as Amy, Emma Watson as Meg, Eliza Scanlen as Beth and Timothee Chalamet as Laurie. This movie felt magical in its entirety, they captured the innocence and kindness of young girls, the harshness of life and the marvel of family and friends. Greta Gerwig really made an incredible job directing this movie, its funny and incredibly sad and beautiful all at the same time. A real homage to the story Louisa May Alcott wrote so many years ago.</p>
<h3>Middle School - The worst years of my life</h3>
<p>This is a heartbreaking movie. I think I watched it for the first time as a kid and liked it. Years later I decided to watch it again, I had to figure out how to find it because i rememberd it vaguely but I did. Anyway, I watched it again and it was amazing, since then I think I've watched it 4 more times and it always captivates me. I weirdly think of it as a comfort movie, it just has this vibe of everything is going to be ok, and everything is possible that always leaves me feeling really good. I recommend it but it's not just a funny fluffy movie, don't let the looks deceive you, it's heavy. </p>
